# Instagram Replica in React Native

Welcome to my React Native project! This ongoing project is a personal journey to develop my mobile application skills by replicating the appearance and functionalities of the popular social media platform Instagram.

## ðŸ“± Overview
This app aims to provide an interactive experience similar to Instagram's, featuring a feed, user interactions through likes and comments, and authentication screens. The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive understanding of mobile app development and enhance my React Native skills.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Includes login and register screens, ensuring users can securely create accounts and access their profiles.
- **Feed Screen**: Displays a list of posts with images, usernames, and profile pictures, simulating a social media feed and a list of stories that can be appreciated and forwarded. You can navigate through the images by tapping in the left or right areas and each story post has its displaying time.
- **Interactive Likes and Comments**: Users can like and comment on posts. Tapping on the likes or comments count opens a modal displaying all users who have interacted.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **React Native**: The core framework for building this cross-platform mobile app.
- **JavaScript**: Main programming language for the project.
- **React Navigation**: For smooth navigation between screens.
- **Vector Icons**: Used for aesthetic icons like hearts, comments, and send icons.
